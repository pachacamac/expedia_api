# Expedia Api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hendricius/expedia_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hendricius/expedia_api)

This is a ruby wrapper for the official Expedia.com API. Please note that the Expedia.com API is a different than the one provided by the Expedia Affiliate Network. They are different companies. If you want to use the EAN Api please use [expedia gem](https://github.com/zaidakram/expedia).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'expedia_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install expedia_api

## Usage

Create an initializer that sets your API key:

```
config/initializers/expedia_api.rb

````

Set the API key:

```
ExpediaApi.api_key = 'my_api_key'

```

Then when using the API create a new client object:

```
client = ExpediaApi::Client.new
```

Search Hotels:
```
client.get_list({})
```

Search Packages:

```
client.search_packages({})
```

The parameters you can pass to `get_list` are the following:

```

  example:
    40.714269,-74.005973

    When this parameter is used, the RADIUS parameter is required.

  example:

    Radius must be less than 200.0km/124.30081 miles. The radius only
    applies to the LOCATION parameter.

    Comma-separated list that specifies the number of adults staying in
    each of the rooms to be requested.
  remark:
    Default value will be 2 if not specified. It indicates only one room
    is required and there are two adults staying in the room. Up to 8
    rooms can be requested at a time.
    Example:
    adults=2,2,2,2 (four rooms with two adults in each room))

  example:
    true
  description:

Please refer to the official API documentation by the Expedia.com team for more parameters.

You can also setup an http proxy. Expedia whitelists IPs that are able to access their API.

```
  ExpediaApi.proxy_uri      = "http://proxy_uri.com:3128"
  ExpediaApi.proxy_password = "foobar"
  ExpediaApi.proxy_user     = "foobar"
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
